# MatchMaster
The HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code creates a "Number Matching Game" web app. It includes a counter that increments, input for a target number, and start/stop/reset buttons. The game checks if the counter matches the target, giving feedback and tracking wins/losses. CSS adapts the style for different screen sizes and device types.
